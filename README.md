# Bayesian Analysis for Nonlinear Regression Models a leaf growth curve

The main purpose of this project is to show how Bayesian inference could be exploited to fit non-linear models for growth curve data. Three widely used models are used to fit growth curve data: Gompertz, Richards and Logistic models which use few parameters having a biological interpretation to describe the entire growth process process (Archontoulis et al.).
